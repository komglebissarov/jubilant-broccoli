# Cloud Infrastructure Engineer
## Take-home technical assessment

## Introduction
The purpose of this assessment is for **sisu-tech** to ascertain the technical suitability of candidates applying for a Cloud Infrastructure Engineer position.

Please note the following:

 - We do not expect this test to take more than 2 hours
 - We recommend to create a new account in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for testing the results.

## Process

 1. Complete the tasks listed below
 2. Edit this `README.md` file to include brief answers to the questions about the assessment listed below
 3. Push your work to your new repository
 4. Send your recruitment contact a link to the new repository

If you have any questions about this process, please speak to your recruitment contact.

## Tasks

### 1. Docker
A basic TypeScript application has been created in the `application` folder. Create a Dockerfile to build this application, making sure that it runs on your local device.

### 2. CI/CD
 - :arrow_forward: Github Actions
 - :arrow_forward: Argo Workflows

Write a YAML-based or Kubernetes-based CI/CD pipeline to build, push and deploy this docker image to some Google Kubernetes Engine cluster.

Create Kubernetes resource definitions needed to deploy the application and include it in the `kubernetes` folder.

Use whatever mechanism/tools you think are appropriate/relevant to deploy the application.

NOTE: This pipeline does not have to be fully active. All we're looking for is the YAML file. Minor syntax errors will be overlooked.

### 3. Infrastructure as Code
 - :arrow_forward: Terraform **CDK in TypeScript** https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cdktf

Create some Infrastructure as Code resources to deploy an Google Cloud Kubernetes Engine and an Cloud SQL database to some Google Cloud account.

The Google Cloud Kubernetes Engine must be able to connect to Google Cloud SQL, and the Kubernetes Cluster will need to be accessed as follows:
 - VPN from IPs `10.26.32.12` and `19.104.105.29`
 - HTTPS traffic from anywhere

Consider other general security best practices.

Other configuration can be decided by yourself, based on the instance being used for a low resource usage, low traffic web application.

## Questions

 1. How long did you spend on this assessment in total?\
 1.5 hours for the task.  
 Around 3 hours for reading docs and conducting experiments with GCP core concepts and CDKTF( It was my first time using both )

 2. What was the most difficult task?\
 Understanding CDKTF, getting used to GCP after Azure (massive upgrade)

 3. If you had an unlimited amount of time to complete this task, what would you have done differently?\
 Priority order:
 - DNS for gke ingress(public) and sql(private)
 - ingress controller and cert manager
 - app and db user for app with workload identity for testing DB conectivity & auth
 - runner infrastructure
 - helm chart for express service
